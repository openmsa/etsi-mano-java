	 * requests to write configurable properties that are not declared in the VNFD
	 * with a "422 Unprocessable entity" error response as defined in clause 6.4 of
	 * ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013 [8]. These configurable properties include the following
	 * standard attributes, which are declared in the VNFD if auto-scaling and/or
	 * auto-healing are supported by the VNF: - isAutoscaleEnabled: If present, the
	 * VNF supports auto-scaling. If set to true, auto-scaling is currently enabled.
	 * If set to false, auto-scaling is currently disabled. - isAutohealEnabled: If
	 * present, the VNF supports auto-healing. If set to true, auto-healing is
	 * currently enabled. If set to false, auto- healing is currently disabled.
	 * These configurable properties can be initialized with default values from the
	 * VNFD (see note 4). Configurable properties can be modified with values passed
	 * in the request structures of certain LCM operations, such as the
	 * InstantiateVnfRequest structure. Further, these configurable properties can
	 * be created, modified or deleted with the PATCH method. In addition, the
	 * provisions in clause 5.7 shall apply.
